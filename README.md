# Working with dplyr


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2023. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the wonderfull world of dynamic webscraping. We will target some things, first of why do webscraping this way, and why not the way we learned it.
